# Tetris
A vanilla javascript game

Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle game from the 80â€™s. Try to get your personal high score by moving each of the 5 randomly selected Tetromino shapes sideways and/or rotating by quarter-turns, so that they form a solid horizontal line without gaps. When such a line is formed, it disappears and any blocks above it fall down to fill the space. For each line you will receive 10 points.
